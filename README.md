# applefonts
A quick dump of all current Apple fonts off of [Apple Developer Fonts](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)

It is rather easy to recreate these steps, as I had only really used two tools in order to first, decompress the ´´´.dmg´´´ file format and then unpack certain files within the decompressed files.
The tools used are:
[7zip](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/7-Zip)
[Ark](https://github.com/KDE/ark)
